      <h1>MSCA Star Qualified</h1>
      <p>As part of an initiative to differentiate HVAC/R service contractors from one another, the Mechanical Service Contractors Association came together and created the STAR qualification program for contractors. <strong>This qualification program is the only one of its kind that is ISO 9001 and ANSI-accredited</strong>. MSCA STAR qualification assures building owners and facility managers that their STAR qualified contractor is providing the highest level of skill, quality, value, and professionalism in the industry. How? To qualify as an MSCA STAR contractor, applicants must meet eight stringent criteria and submit supporting documentation to ensure all criteria are being met. These criteria include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Being an MSCA member in good standing</li>
        <li>Having a proven track record in the HVACR or plumbing service industry</li>
        <li>Having a minimum of 25% of current workforce UA STAR certified</li>
        <li>Having a documented company service safety and health program and maintaining an outstanding safety record</li>
        <li>Providing on-going training to both field and in-house employees</li>
        <li>Having employees attend at least one MSCA or MCAA-sponsored national or local program each year</li>
        <li>Having an established truck inventory control system and major tool inventory program</li>
        <li>Providing and requiring photo ID cards to be worn by all field personnel</li>
        <li>Maintaining the highest levels of customer service standards</li>
      </ul>
      <p>United Cooling and Refrigeration is one of a handful of MSCA STAR qualified contractors. We are a nationally-recognized service and installation company. Please feel free to call us when considering your next HVAC/R project, service issue, or maintenance program.</p>
